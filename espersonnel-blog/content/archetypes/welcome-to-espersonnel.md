# Welcome to Espersonnel

This is my first post on my new blog site. I will be posting about my experiences in the tech world. I hope you enjoy reading my posts.

I'll be posting about the following topics:

- Technology
- 3D
- AI
- VFX

and many more.

## About Me

I am a software developer and a 3D artist. I am passionate about technology and I love to learn new things. I am currently working on a project that will help people learn about technology and how to use it to solve problems. I'm also learning about the 3D and VFX world and I'm excited to share my knowledge with you.

## Portfolio

I'm working on my portfolio. This will include my software development projects as well as my 3D and VFX projects. When I work on my projects, I will post them here so you can see what I'm working on. I'll try my best to keep my projects open source so you can contribute if you want to.
